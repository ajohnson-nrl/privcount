# Noise Parameters File for PrivCount

# Files like this can be created:
# using the "noise config" part of the output from "python statistics_noise.py"
# using the "allocation" file output by the TS when the config is loaded
# (this second method requires an existing noise input file)

# It is safe (albeit potentially confusing) to leave the calculated sigma
# values in these files, they are ignored, and re-calculated each time the file
# is loaded

# THESE NOISE CONFIGURATIONS OFFER ABSOLUTELEY NO PRIVACY AND SHOULD ONLY BE USED
# FOR TESTING PURPOSES IN LOCAL PRIVATE NON-DEPLOYMENT SCENARIOS

# when you modify the counters in this file, run:
# test/test_counter_match.sh

# The overall privacy parameters
privacy:
    delta: 0.0
    epsilon: 0.0
    # the excess noise added so that differential privacy is preserved even if a certain number of (for example) instances, machines, or operators are compromised
    excess_noise_ratio: 0
# optional - defaults as listed
#    epsilon_tolerance: 1.0e-15
#    sigma_ratio_tolerance: 1.0e-6
